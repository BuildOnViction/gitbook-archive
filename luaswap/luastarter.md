## General introduction

### 1. What is LuaStarter?

LuaStarter is a multi-chain Initial DEX Offering platform on Ethereum and TomoChain based on a new Tier Guaranteed System Model.

### 2. What are the problems LuaStarter trying to solve?

In the current DeFi ecosystem, there are several problems such as early investing is not available to the average retail investors, the difficulty to know if projects are trusted among the community, tokens may not be fairly distributed in the offering, scatted tokens, and liquidity provider tokens \(LP tokens\) on multiple chains are not counted together for the IDO registration. 

Several launchpads have been trying to solve these problems by providing fixed and dynamic swap features, fairness model, para-chain crowd loan, anti-bot protection, full KYC integration. Others try to provide high allocation to retail investors \(some launchpad call it capital allocation feature\) or introduce an integrated vesting schedule. 

There are some limitations to all of the above solutions. The first limitation lies in the fact that token holders are not counted for the tokens they hold in more than one chain. Secondly, it requires a cooldown period, reducing the capital efficiency as participants must stake more tokens to join the IDO. Besides, many launchpads require whitelist registration and lottery mechanism, which makes the operation more complex and inefficient as many investors find it hopeless after several attempts without success and must rely on how lucky they are. Furthermore, KYC seems to be a part of a Centralized exchange process rather than a Decentralized exchange offering. 

### 3. How does LuaStarter differ from other launchpads?

At LuaStarter, we envision that integration in Defi and Blockchain plays a vital role in the success of the whole community. Hence, we define LuaStarter’s core values are Security, Integration, and Scalability \(SIS\), becoming the most different approach to other launchpads.  It means that LuaStarter aims to provide the most secure environment, integrate project creators to institutional investors, retail investors, and projects to the Defi ecosystem, then improve the scalability as a whole.

Hence, LuaStarter introduces The Tier Guaranteed System model built on SEAT mechanism to tackle most of the current problems in IDO by total count tokens on supported chains, no cooldown, no whitelist, no lottery, transparently publish the number of tokens investors can buy in advance for better asset management, and the flexibility to participate in the selected project. Equally important, LuaStart applies TOMOE operation model to integrate projects, institutional investors, and retail investors in preparation and development phases.

### 4. What are the tier guaranteed system?

There are fixed 3+1 tier systems based on the total number of tokens and LP-tokens equivalent, enabling all token holders the right to participate in IDO projects. Tokens are allocated to each tier group based on fixed pool weight.

### 5. How to launch project on LuaStarter?

LuaStarter aims for projects which comprehensively demonstrate novel utility on Ethereum and Tomochain ecosystem, then expanding to other chains’ ecosystem such as Polkadot, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, etc…

The project must undergo an intense process including:

* Initial application
* Project Screening
* Kick-off call
* Due diligence check
* Final security check

#### **12. Risk Disclosure**

12.1. The following risks associated with digital assets and the Platform are not exhaustive.

* Wallet address, private key, and backup capabilities

You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your private key and any mnemonic \(backup\) phrase associated with your wallet. You must keep your wallet address, mnemonic \(backup\) phrase, and private key access information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of digital assets associated with the wallet. You are to be fully responsible for safeguarding access to, and any information provided through, the Site and the Platform including, but not limited to, private keys, public keys, key seeds and address details.

Your wallet is not accessible by the Company, and the Company does not receive or store your wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted private key, or mnemonic \(backup\) phrase associated with your wallet. We cannot, therefore, assist you with wallet password retrieval. If you have not safely stored a backup of any wallet address and private key pairs maintained in your wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any digital assets you have associated with such a wallet address will become inaccessible if you do not have your wallet password.

* Digital asset transactions

In order to be completed, all proposed digital asset transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the corresponding public blockchain. By using the Platform, you acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by that public blockchain network.

Once transaction details have been submitted via the Platform, we cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction. You must ensure that you have an adequate balance in your wallet and/or gas to complete transactions before initiating a transaction.

* Software protocols and operational challenges

The software protocols that underlie digital assets are typically open-source projects, which means that \(i\) the development and control of such digital assets are outside of the Company’s control and \(ii\) such software protocols are subject to sudden and dramatic changes that might have a significant impact on the availability, usability or value of a given digital asset.

You are aware of and accept the risk of operational challenges. The Company may experience sophisticated cyber attacks, unexpected surges in activity, or other operational or technical difficulties that may cause interruptions to the Platform and the Site. You understand that the Platform and the Site may experience operational issues that lead to delays. You agree to accept the risk of transaction failure resulting from unanticipated or heightened technical difficulties, including those resulting from sophisticated attacks. You agree not to hold the Company accountable for any related losses.

All users understand that the technology underlying digital assets is subject to change at any time, and such changes may affect the Platform. You claim full responsibility for monitoring such technological changes and understanding their consequences for your digital assets. The Company does not take any responsibility for any loss or damage incurred as a result of your use of the Platform or your failure to understand the risks involved associated with digital assets use generally or your use of our Services.

* Legislative and regulatory changes

Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the domestic or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of digital assets.

* Other risk

You understand and agree that the Company has no control over, and no duty to take any action including, but not limited to:

* Failures, disruptions, errors, or delays in processing digital assets that you may experience while using the Platform;
* The risk of failure of hardware, software, and Internet connections;
* The risk of malicious software being introduced or found in the software underlying our Platform;
* The risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet, including, but not limited to your wallet address, private key, and mnemonic \(backup\) phrase;
* Disasters may damage the digital asset systems resulting in loss of digital assets held by users.
* Mistakes made by the user of any digital asset-related software or service, e.g., forgotten passwords, and digital assets sent to wrong addresses.
* Software problems of any digital asset-related software or service, e.g., corrupted wallet file, incorrectly constructed transactions, unsafe cryptographic libraries, malware affecting the wallet and/or any digital asset-related software or service.
* Technical failures in the hardware of the user of any digital asset-related software or service, e.g., data loss due to a faulty or damaged storage device.
* Security problems experienced by the user of any digital asset-related software or service, e.g., unauthorized access to users' wallets and/or accounts.
* Actions or inactions of third parties and/or events experienced by third parties, e.g., bankruptcy of service providers, information security attacks on service providers, and fraud conducted by third parties.
