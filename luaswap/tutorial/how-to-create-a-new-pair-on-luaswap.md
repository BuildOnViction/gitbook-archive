### Step 3: Add liquidity

You need to add initial liquidity for your pair. You need to cover both sides, so you will be depositing both tokens into the pool. Depending on how much you deposit of both, the price will be automatically set. Note that the amount of liquidity you add to the pool will determine the initial rate of the token.
