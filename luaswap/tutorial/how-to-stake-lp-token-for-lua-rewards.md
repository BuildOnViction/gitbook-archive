# How to farm LUA rewards

The LUA token distribution will start at block **10,950,600** on September 28, 2020. 

The LUA token will only be minted and distributed to Liquidity Providers \(LPs\) of 9 pools of the [Golden Field](https://forum.tomochain.com/t/golden-field-proposal-for-luaswaps-reward-allocation/931).

## Stake LP tokens into LuaSwap

Once you have added liquidity on LuaSwap, deposit the LP tokens to the LuaSwap contract of the corresponding LuaSwap field using the interface at [https://app.luaswap.org/\#/farming](https://app.luaswap.org/#/farming). To learn how to stake your LP tokens to get LUA reward, read the following tutorial carefully.

### **Step 1: Have 2 tokens with the ratio 50: 50**

You need to have 2 ****tokens of the pool you want to farm LUA, with the ratio 50 : 50 \(based on USDT rate\). Using [TomoBridge](https://bridge.tomochain.com/) to convert back & forth between ERC20 tokens and TRC21 ones .

### **Step 2: Add liquidity into the pool**

Then, you need to add liquidity for your pair on [https://app.luaswap.org/\#/add](https://app.luaswap.org/#/add) by depositing both tokens into the pool and get your LP tokens.

_Note:_  _Using LuaSwap’s Ethereum version requires the Metamask network to be set to Ethereum. Likewise using LuaSwap’s TomoChain version requires the Metamask network to be set to TomoChain. Follow_ [_this guide_ ](https://docs.tomochain.com/general/how-to-connect-to-tomochain-network/metamask)_to learn more._

### Step 4: Stake LP tokens

First, choose the field you want to stake. For each of these fields, you’ll stake a different LP token. In this example, we selected the LP tokens from the TOMOE - USDT pool.

You’ll see the total LP tokens staked in the field and the amount of LUA being rewarded per block. To stake, you need to Approve TOMOE-USDT LUA V1 LP.

Once approved you will be asked to confirm on your wallet to grant permission to allow LuaSwap to withdraw your LP tokens and automate transactions for you.

Click the **Stake** button.

Enter the amount of LP token you want to stake into LuaSwap. You can see your current balance of liquidity pool tokens here. 

### Step 5: Confirm

Click **Confirm** to approve the transaction

Once this is completed with transaction approval, you will see that your LP tokens have been staked, now sit back and wait for your LUA rewards to arrive.

## Unstake LP token from LuaSwap

You can harvest your LUA at any time, unstake your LP tokens, and take them back to LuaSwap to retrieve your TOMOE and USDT.

### **Step 1: Go to luaswap.org**

then click on **Farm** in the **Product** tab

### Step 2: Select a pool

Choose the field that you have staked your LP token, then click **UnStake**.

Enter the amount of LUA-V1LP token you want to withdraw from LuaSwap.

### Step 3: Confirm

Click Confirm and approve that transaction on your wallet. Once it approved, you can see your LP tokens have been unstaked, then you can simply go back to LuaSwap and retrieve your tokens by removing liquidity.

Remember to do your own research, and understand how LuaSwap works before you start providing liquidity on LuaSwap and staking your LP tokens on LuaSwap to farm LUA. If you need any help, feel free to contact us on telegram:[ https://t.me/LuaSwap](https://t.me/LuaSwap)
