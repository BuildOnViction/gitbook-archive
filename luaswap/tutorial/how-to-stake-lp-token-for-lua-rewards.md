First you’ll see the total LP tokens staked in the field and the amount of LUA being rewarded per block. To stake, first  click on “Approve TOMOE-USDT LUA V1 LP”.

Once approved you will be asked to confirm on your Metamask to grant permission to allow LuaSwap to withdraw your LP tokens and automate transactions for you. 

Click the “Stake” button

Enter the amount of LP token you want to stake into LuaSwap. You can see your current balance of liquidity pool tokens here. Then click “Confirm”
