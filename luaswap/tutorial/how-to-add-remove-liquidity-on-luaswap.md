**Warning**: Due to the potential of impermanent loss, you may receive a different distribution of tokens upon redemption than you initially added. That means the ratio of your token may change over time. Please educate yourself on the risks of providing liquidity and the concept of [impermanent loss](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/advanced-topics/understanding-returns/) before participating
