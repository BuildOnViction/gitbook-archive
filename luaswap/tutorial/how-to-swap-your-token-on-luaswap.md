_Note: You need to pay attention to some details including Price/ Minimum received/Price Impact/Liquidity provider fee \(0.35% of each trade\). Tx fee in the TomoChain is much lower than Ethereum \(~ 0.00003 TOMO/swap\)_

Click **Swap** to confirm the transaction 

**Step 3: Confirm the transaction**

A pop-up window would appear to confirm the gas prices to be paid for the transaction.

Input the gas prices you wish to pay then click **Confirm**
