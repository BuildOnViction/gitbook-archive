# Tier requirements & allocation

The token allocation for IDO projects on LuaStarter is powered by the Tier Guaranteed System (TGS), which consists of 4+1 tier levels based on the total number of LUA tokens staked, enabling everyone an equal right to participate in the IDO projects. The IDO token supply will be allocated to each tier depending on the amount of base token input and pool weight of each tier member.

## **Tier Requirements**

Users are required to stake their LUA tokens in the designated protocols (see table below) to be qualified for a tier and secure a minimum guaranteed allocation of the IDO token. 

| **Eligible staking protocols** | **LUA equivalency** |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| LUA staked in LuaSafe          | = LUA x 1           |
| LUA staked in LUA-TOMO(E)\*    | = LUA x 2           |

_\*the LP tokens staked in farming pools must be unstaked before the deadline._

Users are required to have their LUA tokens staked in **LuaSafe** or added in **LUA-TOMO(E)\*** liquidity pool (either **TomoChain** or **Ethereum**) to be qualified for a tier and secure a minimum guaranteed allocation of the IDO token

LUA tokens must be added in the designated protocols at least **7 days** before and remain staked until the IDO opens.

Each member’s minimum guaranteed allocation depends on one’s own pool weight, and the total pool size, which is the sum of every tier member’s pool weight.

_**Guaranteed allocation =  IDO token supply/pool size \* pool weight**_

## **Token Commitment & Allocation**

**Token Commitment**

Once the IDO pool is open, users can find the minimum guaranteed allocation of the IDO token in their profile. They can now commit any amount of the base token in exchange for the IDO token. Non-tier members can also make a token commitment that is not higher than half of the maximum allowed amount of tier 1 (Earth tier) members. \


**Final Allocation**

Part of the IDO token supply, if not all, will be first allocated to meet the minimum guaranteed allocation of all the tier members who have made a commitment. 

The remaining supply will be allocated to all the participants who have committed more than the minimum allocation on a first-come, first-served basis.
