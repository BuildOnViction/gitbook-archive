The swap fee is set at [**0.4%**](https://snapshot.luaswap.org/#/luaswap/proposal/QmW7cc1u8PYYZyaQmsUkL1tcZComuqjApzKGw2up58oLdE), of which 0.05% goes to LuaSafe stakers \(more on LuaSafe below\), and the remaining 0.35% goes to LPs.

### Withdrawal fee for liquidity provider

A withdrawal fee of [0.1%](https://snapshot.luaswap.org/#/luaswap/proposal/QmVL4Z66vucbX1GB8QfHrdqNvH6gGN8vvfL3r3ztCZwhoT) is applied when an LP chooses to remove liquidity and exit. This fee is used to encourage long-term LPs and to create a healthier liquidity environment for LuaSwap users.

### Withdrawal fee for staker on LuaSafe

There is a flat fee of 0.5% levied for all withdrawals from LuaSafe. Withdrawals can be done at any time.
