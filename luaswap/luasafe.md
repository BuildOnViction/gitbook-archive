# LuaSafe

[LuaSafe](https://luaswap.org/#/Staking) is LuaSwap’s LUA-specific staking pool, where LUA holders can stake LUA to earn passive income.

LuaSafe income is generated through a portion of fees collected and distributed in the following way:

* 0.05% from swap fees across all pairs 
* 0.1% from withdrawal fees for LPs withdrawing liquidity from liquidity pools.
* [0.5%](https://snapshot.luaswap.org/#/luaswap/proposal/QmRheZC6Ap1u2myBkL3CAbKft6Lnw4oHvEDh1RDAuNK8iA) from users withdrawing their LUA staked in LuaSafe

All income generated by LuaSafe that is not denominated in LUA is used to automatically **market buy** LUA . After the **market buy** step all LuaSafe income will be in LUA and proportionately distributed added directly back intoto  the LuaSafe stakersing pool automatically . LuaSafe reward calculation and ‘distribution’ are programmed in the smart contract and can be called by anyone at any time.

“CONVERT" button on LuaSafe will trigger reward distribution for the selected pair by calling 2 functions directly to the smart contract LuaMaker, which will perform the following:

\(1\) Burn collected LP tokens from withdrawal fees and swap fees

\(2\) Buy LUA at market price and send it into the LuaSafe contract.

The core team will trigger distribution every Monday, generally around noon Singapore time \(GMT+8\) or earlier if the pair's collected fee reaches a certain significant amount \(equivalent to at least 3,000 LUA after converted\). Users do not need to pay any gas fee for the distribution unless they choose to manually trigger the distribution process themselves. Anyone can trigger distribution at any time by selecting the “CONVERT" buttons. Users need to pay the gas fee for the distribution if they choose to do it themselves.

Users who stake LUA in LuaSafe will receive xLUA LP tokens which represent their proportion of LUA staked. xLUA LP tokens will collect all income generated by LuaSafe. Stakers will need to withdraw their xLUA LP tokens in order to receive their original LUA staked plus all LUA income earned through the fees collected in the LuaSafe staking pool. There is a flat fee of 0.5% levied for all withdrawals. Withdrawals can be done at any time.
