# LuaSafe

[LuaSafe](https://luaswap.org/#/Staking) is LuaSwap’s LUA-specific staking pool, where LUA holders can stake LUA to earn passive income.

LuaSafe income is generated through a portion of fees collected and distributed in the following way:

* 0.05% from swap fees across all pairs 
* 0.1% from withdrawal fees for LPs withdrawing liquidity from liquidity pools.
* [0.5%](https://snapshot.luaswap.org/#/luaswap/proposal/QmRheZC6Ap1u2myBkL3CAbKft6Lnw4oHvEDh1RDAuNK8iA) from users withdrawing their LUA staked in LuaSafe

All income generated by LuaSafe is used to automatically **market buy** LUA and distribute it to the LuaSafe staking pool on a daily basis.

Users who stake LUA in LuaSafe will receive xLUA LP tokens which represent their proportion of LUA staked. xLUA LP tokens will collect all income generated by LuaSafe. Stakers will need to withdraw their xLUA LP tokens in order to receive their original LUA staked plus all LUA income earned through the fees collected in the LuaSafe staking pool. There is a flat fee of 0.5% levied for all withdrawals. Withdrawals can be done at any time.

We hope you love this update with the introduction of LuaSwap v1.0. There is much more planned in the coming weeks ahead for LuaSwap. Let us know what features you’d like added.
