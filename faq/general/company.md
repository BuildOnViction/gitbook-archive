### **Where can I take a look at TomoChain code? Is there a GitHub repository?**

All the code regarding TomoChain is free to access on our [GitHub](https://github.com/tomochain). This includes the code for the TomoChain blockchain client, governance Dapp, block explorer, tools, docker images, documentation, etc.

We like to publish code publicly when it reaches a certain level of development and/or when we think auditing and contributions are beneficial to the codebase. Keeping early projects private is probably more responsible for now due to our scale. It might change in the future.

We are also working with some third parties with which we signed a non-disclosure-agreements for code development.
