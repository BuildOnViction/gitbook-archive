# Ecosystem

### **What are the incentives for partners and Dapp developers to build on TomoChain?**

TomoChain supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers. This means that any smart-contract written in Ethereum protocol can be easily ported to TomoChain.

Any smart contract written in Ethereum can be seamlessly ported to TomoChain, instantly enjoying all TomoChain advantages: almost zero-transaction fee; 2-second confirmation time; 2'000 TPS 

Dapp developers also have dedicated technical support from TomoChain developers.

Besides the technical aspects, our partners will also benefit from the TomoChain community support and fundraising opportunities.
