## What is TomoRelayer? 

[TomoRelayer](https://relayer.testnet.tomochain.com/login) is a DEX portal which follows TomoChain’s design and interacts with the underlying TomoX protocol. By using TomoRelayer, anyone can propose their own decentralized exchange by depositing 25,000 TOMO. The design used in TomoRelayer assists the owners in monitoring, analyzing and controlling digital assets on their exchange platform with a professional dashboard.

Key features of TomoRelayer:

* **Interoperability:** Enables trading of any TRC-20 or TRC-21 asset. Any token that follows these standards can be traded on a TomoX-integrated DEX.
* **Professional Dashboard**: Provides information management that tracks the key performance of your DEX.
* **Liquidity Network**: Provides one giant tradable order book for every token. Whether you’re trading on the most popular exchange or the least popular exchange, the token order book will always be the same.
