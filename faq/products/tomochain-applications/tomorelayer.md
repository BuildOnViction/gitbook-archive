## What is TomoRelayer? 

[TomoRelayer](https://relayer.testnet.tomochain.com/login) is a DEX portal which follows TomoChain’s design and interacts with the underlying TomoX protocol. By using TomoRelayer, anyone can propose their own decentralized exchange by depositing 25.000 TOMO. The design used in TomoRelayer assists the owners in monitoring, analyzing and controlling digital assets on their exchange platform with a professional dashboard.
