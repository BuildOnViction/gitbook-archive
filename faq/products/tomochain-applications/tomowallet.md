### **How do I protect my funds from scammers?**

Every wallet consists of two parts - public key and private key. TomoWallet stores your private key directly on your device. There are a couple of formats TomoWallet can display your private key in:

* Private key - an unencrypted collection of numbers and letters that unlocks access to your address on various blockchains
* Mnemonic phrase - 12 words used to secure your private key. Much easier to remember.

No service should ever ask you for your private key. Anyone with your private key can access your wallet and have FULL CONTROL of your funds.

You can always have multiple copies of your backup, if you think you can store it safely. Any valid backup \(private key/ mnemonic\) will get you to the most current state of your wallet. We at TomoWallet, donâ€™t have access to your wallet or your private key. We are not able to help you recover your backup if you lose your device and your backup. Please make sure you store your backup\(s\) in a safe place.
