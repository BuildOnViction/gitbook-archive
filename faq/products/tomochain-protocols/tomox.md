# TomoX Protocol

### What is TomoX?

TomoX is a secure and efficient permissionless decentralized exchange \(DEX\) protocol that empowers a diverse system of DEXs, MM providers, and independent projects to work together in a decentralized manner. Launch a DEX in just a few minutes without extensive technical knowledge and with minimal development upkeep costs.

### What is TomoDEX?

TomoDEX is the DEX on TomoX run by TomoChain Pte. Ltd

### What is a Relayer \(DEX\)?

Relayer is another word for a decentralized exchange \(DEX\).

### What is the difference between TomoX and a Decentralized Exchange?

TomoX is the core decentralized exchange protocol that sits as a technological layer under the decentralized exchanges \(DEX\). It is integrated into the core layer of the TomoChain blockchain consensus and is in charge of order matching and execution. A DEX in TomoChainâ€™s design interacts with the underlying TomoX protocol and will send/receive trade orders to/from TomoX, which processes these trade orders.

### **How to become a DEX using TomoX?**

Anyone can propose a DEX by depositing 25,000 TOMO on the TomoRelayer portal. 

A maximum number of 150 Relayers can be launched and run. New slot availability will only be possible when an existing Relayer resigns.

### **What are the incentives to run a DEX?** 

DEX operators can focus on marketing strategies to attract traders instead of worrying about the technical issues of maintaining an exchange. In addition DEXs on TomoX are non-custodial, making operations less risky. We believe that there should be an incentive mechanism distributing trading fees to Masternodes and DEX Operators. For example, a 50/50 sharing ratio between a Masternode and the Operator would be a reasonable option. However, this ratio is not hard-coded and can be negotiated between Masternodes and Relayers.

### What type of digital assets are supported by TomoX?

TomoX supports TOMO and TomoChain TRC21 tokens. Besides that, TomoX will support other native token and major crypto-asset through TomoBridge like BTC, ETH and USDT.  More standards will be gradually integrated into TomoX.

### Do users need to have TOMO to pay the fees?

Trading fees on DEX are paid in tokens you are trading, which results in a smoother user experience compared to other decentralized exchanges.
