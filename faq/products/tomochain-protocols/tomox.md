# TomoX Protocol

### What is TomoX?

TomoX is a secure and efficient permissionless decentralized exchange \(DEX\) protocol that empowers a diverse system of DEXes, MM providers, and independent projects to work together in a decentralized manner. Launch a DEX in just a few minutes without extensive technical knowledge and with minimal development upkeep costs.

### What is TomoDEX?

TomoDEX is the DEX on TomoX Testnet run by TomoChain Pte. Ltd

### What is a Relayer \(DEX\)?

Relayer is another word for a decentralized exchange \(DEX\).

### What is difference between TomoX and a Decentralized Exchange?

TomoX is the core decentralized exchange protocol that sits as a technological layer under the decentralized exchanges \(DEX\). It is integrated into the core layer of the TomoChain blockchain consensus and is in charge of order matching and execution. A DEX in TomoChainâ€™s design interacts with the underlying TomoX protocol and will send/receive trade orders to/from TomoX, which processes these trade orders.

### **How to become a DEX using TomoX?**

Anyone can propose a DEX by depositing 25,000 TOMO on the TomoRelayer portal.

### **What are the incentives to running a DEX?** 

DEX operators can focus on marketing strategies to attract traders. We believe that there should be an incentive mechanism distributing trading fees to masternodes and operators. For example, a 50/50 sharing ratio between a masternode and the operator would be a reasonable option. However, this ratio is not hard-coded and can be negotiated between masternodes and relayers.

### What type of digital assets are supported by TomoX?

TomoX supports TomoChain standards including TRC20, TRC21 and TOMO native token. Besides that, TomoX will support other native token and major crypto-asset through TomoBridge like BTC, ETH and USDT, more standards will be gradually integrated into TomoX.

### Do users need to have TOMO to pay the fees?

Trading fees on DEX are paid in tokens, which results in a smoother user experience compared to other decentralized exchanges.
