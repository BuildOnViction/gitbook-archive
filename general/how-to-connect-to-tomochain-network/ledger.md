**Note:** Select **TOMO (tomochain.com)** the crypto asset network in the top-right corner. Select m/44'/60'/0'/0 as the derivation path

### Connect to TomoMaster

TomoMaster is the decentralized governance Dapp of TomoChain, allowing users to vote/unvote for masternodes and apply to become a Masternode Candidate.

* Make sure the Ledger Nano S device is powered on, unlocked and the TomoChain Dapp is open
* Plug the Ledger Nano S into your PC/Laptop
* Go to [TomoMaster](https://master.tomochain.com/) using a U2F compatible browser
* Click on Login button (top right)
* Select Ledger Wallet from the dropdown list
* Choose m/44’/60’/0’/0 path if the Ledger Nano S has the latest firmware. Otherwise, use m/44’/889’/0’/0 path
