# TomoChain the Platform

## **About TomoChain**

The TomoChain blockchain and product ecosystem allows entrepreneurs, enterprises, and institutions to build high-performance, and feature-rich blockchain projects on an enhanced EVM-compatible platform. An array of original features and protocols, designed to support usersâ€™ speed, privacy, usability, and liquidity needs all in one platform.

TomoChain is built on a performance layer that achieves high transaction speeds without compromising decentralization. TomoChain uses an innovative consensus method called PoSV \(Proof of Stake Voting\) which gives an incentive to all TomoChain token-holders to play an active part in staking across a network of 150 high-quality Masternodes, and to monitor their performance and governance actively. The staking-governance Dapp, TomoMaster, is recognized as one of the leading staking platforms in the industry.

In particular, we propose a solution for solving the transaction processing performance bottleneck in Ethereum which hinders its adoption into industries, especially finance. More specifically, we are constructing an efficient and secured consensus protocol, which tackles the following main bottlenecks of classic blockchains:

* **Efficiency**: The small throughput of Bitcoin and Ethereum severely hinders a widespread adoption of such crypto- currencies.
* **Confirmation times**: Bitcoin takes on average 1 hour to confirm a transaction because the confirmation of a Bitcoin block requires 5 subsequent blocks created following it. While Ethereum uses a smaller block-time, the average confirmation time still remains relatively high, around 13 minutes. These long confirmation times hinder many important applications \(especially smart contract applications\).

In the technical paper, TomoChain proposes the Proof-of-Stake Voting \(PoSV\) consensus, which is a PoS-based blockchain protocol with a fair voting mechanism, rigorous security guarantees, and uniform probability eventually. The consensus has the following key novelties:

* Double Validation to strengthen security and reduce the risk of a blockchain fork
* Randomization provides security, and prevents handshaking attacks
* Fast confirmation time and efficient checkpoints for finality or rebase
