  TomoChain uses an innovative consensus method called Proof-of-Stake Voting
  which provides an incentive to all TOMO holders to play an active part in
  staking across a network of 150 Masternodes.

# PoSV Consensus

### Overview

At the heart of TomoChain, the Proof-of-Stake Voting consensus enables it as an  
EVM-compatible and scalable public blockchain, on which every Ethereum smart contract can be run efficiently and with almost instant transaction confirmation.

* Token holders deposit 50,000 TOMO to become a Masternode Candidate
* Token holders vote for Masternode Candidates
* Most voted Candidates are selected as Masternodes
* Masternodes create blocks in a round-robin and double validation
* Masternodes finalizing blocks are incentivized

**High Performance** 

Massive acceleration of blockchain performance is one of the most important key features of TomoChain. With our proposed PoSV consensus protocol, TomoChain provides:

* At least 2k TPS while still enhancing security through Double Validation
* 2-second block-time and transaction confirmed within 4-second
* Significant improvements of user experience and the reasoning for the use of blockchain
* TPS will be dramatically increased once sharding is enabled

###  Double Validation

Double validation provides an additional trustworthy validation layer for security enhancement through a provable uniform distribution decentralized randomization. Specifically, when a block is created by a Masternode, it must be verified by another Masternode that is randomly selected among the set of Masternodes before being added to the blockchain. Double validation strengthens TomoChainâ€™s security, reduces the risk of a fork occurring, and nothing-at-stake attacks, making TomoChain unique among Proof-of-Stake based blockchains.
