  TomoChain uses an innovative consensus method called Proof-of-Stake Voting
  which provides an incentive to all TOMO holders to play an active part in
  staking across a network of 150 Masternodes.

# PoSV Consensus

### Overview

TomoChain is an EVM compatible blockchain powered by the scalable Proof-of-Stake Voting consensus mechanism that allows every Ethereum smart contract to run with almost instant transaction confirmation. 150 Masternodes secure the TomoChain blockchain and allow for the following:

* Token holders deposit 50,000 TOMO to become a Masternode Candidate
* Token holders vote for Masternode Candidates
* Most voted Candidates are selected as Masternodes
* Masternodes create blocks in round-robin and use double validation to prevent collusion
* Masternodes finalizing blocks are incentivized

**High Performance **

Massive acceleration of blockchain performance is one of the most important key features of TomoChain. With the PoSV consensus protocol, TomoChain provides:

* At least 2,000 TPS while still enhancing security through Double Validation
* 2-second block-time and transaction confirmed within 4 seconds

### Double Validation

Double validation provides an additional trustworthy validation layer for security enhancement through provable uniform distribution decentralized randomization. Specifically, when a block is created by a Masternode, it must be verified by another Masternode that is randomly selected among the set of Masternodes before being added to the blockchain. Double validation strengthens TomoChainâ€™s security, reduces the risk of forks, and nothing-at-stake attacks, making TomoChain unique among Proof-of-Stake based blockchains.
