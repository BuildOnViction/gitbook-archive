## **How to Register a New Relayer** <a id="eac2"></a>

A 25,000 TOMO deposit is required to register your relayer, which may be withdrawn later. The 25,000 TOMO deposit will be divided into 2 parts:

* Locked Funds: 20,000 TOMO will be locked and only be available for withdrawal 30 days after the relayer owner makes a decision to resign.
* Trading Fee Fund: 5,000 TOMO will be used for paying network fees, and be deducted from as fees are sent to Masternodes for handling trades and order processing.

A Relayer owner can resign the relayer position at any time. If the Trading Fee Fund is not empty, the relayer owner can withdraw the remaining funds along with the locked funds 4 weeks after resigning.
