{% hint style="info" %}
Relayer fees: Fees that relayers must pay the Masternode network. These fees will be automatically deducted from the \*Trading Fee Fund when successfully matched. 

The 25,000 TOMO deposit of the Relayer Owner will be divided into 2 parts:

* Locked Funds: 20,000 TOMO will be locked and only be available for withdrawal 30 days after the relayer owner makes a decision to resign. 
* Trading Fee Fund: 5,000 TOMO will be used for paying network fees, and be deducted from as fees are sent to masternodes for handling trades and order processing
