### 13. Limitation of Liability&#x20;

13.1. You acknowledge and confirm that you have carefully considered the risks involved in wrapping and unwrapping digital assets through our Platform. The following risks associated with digital assets and the Platform are not exhaustive.

1. Wallet address, private key, and backup capabilities.

You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your private key and any mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your wallet. You must keep your wallet address, mnemonic (backup) phrase, and private key access information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of digital assets associated with the wallet. You are to be fully responsible for safeguarding access to, and any information provided through, the Site and the Platform including, but not limited to, private keys, public keys, key seeds and address details.

Your wallet is not accessible by the Company, and the Company does not receive or store your wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted private key, or mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your wallet. We cannot, therefore, assist you with wallet password retrieval. If you have not safely stored a backup of any wallet address and private key pairs maintained in your wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any digital assets you have associated with such a wallet address will become inaccessible if you do not have your wallet password.

1. Digital asset transactions.&#x20;

In order to be completed, all proposed digital asset transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the corresponding public blockchain. By using the Platform, you acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by that public blockchain network.

Once transaction details have been submitted via the Platform, we cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction. You must ensure that you have an adequate balance in your wallet and/or gas to complete transactions before initiating a transaction.&#x20;

1. Attack on blockchain networks

The Company cannot prevent or mitigate attacks on blockchain networks and has no obligation to engage in activity in relation to such attacks. In the event of an attack, the Company reserves the right to take commercially reasonable actions, including, but not limited to, if we confirm that a digital asset’s network is compromised or under attack, immediately halting wrapping and unwrapping for such digital asset. Resolutions concerning unwrapping for a digital asset that has had its network attacked will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Company in its sole discretion. The Company makes no representation and does not warrant the safety of the Platform and you assume all liability for any lost value or stolen property.&#x20;

1. Software protocols and operational challenges

The software protocols that underlie digital assets are typically open-source projects, which means that (i) the development and control of such digital assets are outside of the Company’s control and (ii) such software protocols are subject to sudden and dramatic changes that might have a significant impact on the availability, usability or value of a given digital asset.

You are aware of and accept the risk of operational challenges. The Company may experience sophisticated cyber attacks, unexpected surges in activity, or other operational or technical difficulties that may cause interruptions to the Platform and the Site. You understand that the Platform and the Site may experience operational issues that lead to delays. You agree to accept the risk of transaction failure resulting from unanticipated or heightened technical difficulties, including those resulting from sophisticated attacks. You agree not to hold the Company accountable for any related losses.

All users understand that the technology underlying digital assets is subject to change at any time, and such changes may affect the Platform. You claim full responsibility for monitoring such technological changes and understanding their consequences for your digital assets. The Company does not take any responsibility for any loss or damage incurred as a result of your use of the Platform or your failure to understand the risks involved associated with digital assets use generally or your use of our Services&#x20;

1. Legislative and regulatory changes

Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the domestic or international level may adversely affect the transfer, wrapping and unwrapping of digital assets.

1. Other risk&#x20;

You understand and agree that the Company has no control over, and no duty to take any action including, but not limited to:

* Failures, disruptions, errors, or delays in processing digital assets that you may experience while using the Platform;
* The risk of failure of hardware, software, and Internet connections;
* The risk of malicious software being introduced or found in the software underlying our Platform;
* The risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet, including, but not limited to your wallet address, private key, and mnemonic (backup) phrase;
* Disasters may damage the digital asset systems resulting in loss of digital assets held by users.
* Mistakes made by the user of any digital asset-related software or service, e.g., forgotten passwords, and digital assets sent to wrong addresses.
* Software problems of any digital asset-related software or service, e.g., corrupted wallet file, incorrectly constructed transactions, unsafe cryptographic libraries, malware affecting the wallet and/or any digital asset-related software or service
* Technical failures in the hardware of the user of any digital asset-related software or service, e.g., data loss due to a faulty or damaged storage device
* Security problems experienced by the user of any digital asset-related software or service, e.g., unauthorized access to users' wallets and/or accounts
* Actions or inactions of third parties and/or events experienced by third parties, e.g., bankruptcy of service providers, information security attacks on service providers, and fraud conducted by third parties.

13.2. You acknowledge and confirm that you have made your own independent decision to make any wrapping or any unwrapping action and that your decision is based on such information as you deem appropriate under the circumstances and is without reliance upon the Company or any member of the Company.
