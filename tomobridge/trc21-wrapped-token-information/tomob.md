# TOMOB

In order to transfer value on the Binance Chain, tokens must be compatible with the [Binance Chain Evolution Proposal 2](https://github.com/binance-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEP2.md) \(BEP2\). BEP2 is a token management set of rules and pre-defined criteria implemented to launch on-chain assets on Binance Chain

TomoChain has issued BEP-2 TOMO tokens on Binance Chain called TOMOB. With the creation of TOMOB, we have locked up an equal number of native TOMO to ensure the total supply remains the same.
