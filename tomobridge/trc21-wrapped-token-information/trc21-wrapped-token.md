# TomoChain Wrapped Tokens

TomoChain wrapped tokens are hosted on the TomoChain public blockchain, and backed by an equivalent amount of the underlying assets or currencies from a different blockchain network. There are two types of TomoChain wrapped tokens including **TRC20 wrapped token** and **TRC21 wrapped token**.

TomoChain wrapped tokens stay in your wallet throughout trading, and can be converted from and to the native assets anytime via [TomoBridge](https://bridge.tomochain.com/). So it's almost like trading native assets directly. When TomoChain wrapped tokens are redeemed for native tokens, they will be burned. The minting and burning of TomoChain wrapped tokens are tracked and verifiable via a smart contract on TomoScan.

TomoChain wrapped tokens can bring more liquidity from other blockchain networks, and allow the token holders to benefit from the fast transactions and low fees of the TomoChain blockchain. TomoChain wrapped tokens can be transferred, traded, integrated into other dapps just like the native tokens on TomoChain.

## **What are the differences between TRC20 and TRC21 wrapped tokens?**

Essentially, these two types of wrapped tokens are TRC20 and TRC21 standard tokens respectively. Check below for the differences between TRC20 and TRC21 tokens.

**TRC20:** TRC20 is an equivalent token standard of ERC20 built on top of the TomoChain blockchain. TRC20 token holders would need to hold a small amount of TOMO to cover the extremely low transaction fees.&#x20;

TRC20 wrapped tokens can be easily integrated into other Dapps and get listed on exchanges. More Dapps and projects on TomoChain are expected to be integrating and utilising TRC20 wrapped tokens in the future.

TRC20 wrapped tokens can be traded on LuaSwap. \


**TRC21:** TRC21, creates a frictionless experience for non-crypto users by allowing token holders to pay transaction fees by the token itself without having to hold any TOMO in their wallet.&#x20;

TRC21 wrapped tokens can be traded on LuaSwap.\
