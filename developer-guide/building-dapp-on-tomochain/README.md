# Build a Dapp on TomoChain

In this guide:

* Setting up Truffle, the most popular development framework for Ethereum which also works perfectly for TomoChain
* Creating a Truffle project
* Creating a TomoChain wallet
* Requesting free tokens using TomoChain faucet
* Writing a smart contract
* Compiling and migrating the smart contract to TomoChain
* Connecting Metamask to TomoChain Testnet
* Creating a user interface to interact with the smart contract

### Why should developers build Dapps on TomoChain? <a id="8c4b"></a>

Remember [_CryptoKitties_](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) in 2017? A single Dapp brought the whole Ethereum blockchain to their knees. The network was congested, with endless waiting times for transaction confirmation and high transaction fees. Porting to TomoChain would seem a good idea for the cute kitties.

TomoChain Mainnet can process 2,000 TPS, wich is **100x faster than the Ethereum blockchain,** and for a fraction of the cost.

In this tutorial, we will see **how to build a Dapp using Solidity** and then deploy it to **TomoChain** blockchain.

> **Note:** Because deploying a smart contract on Mainnet is much similar to Testnet, the differences are just the configuration information, this document will explicitly mention the differences where possible
